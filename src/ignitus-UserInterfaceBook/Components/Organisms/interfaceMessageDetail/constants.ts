      'Hello Sophia, \n Professor Fiji suggested I reach out to you because the topic of your senior thesis is African-American history. I know you have done extensive research in this area, and I think meeting with you before I start your thesis would help you get started in the right direction. Would you be available for a short meeting next week? I look forward to your reply.',
