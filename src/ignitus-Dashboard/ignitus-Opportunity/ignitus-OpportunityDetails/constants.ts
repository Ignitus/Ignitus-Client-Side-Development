  'Project Description This project will advance our understanding of the operation of the law, and of legal specialists, in Scotland from the late fifteenth to the early seventeenth century. Aberdeen and the North-East present a rich source-base with which to pursue this theme. Manuscript sources held in the University’s Special Collections Centre and in the Aberdeen City & Aberdeenshire Archives are ripe for the investigation of the range of law courts which functioned in the region, at franchise, burgh, sheriffdom, and church levels. The era of the Reformation brought significant change to the nature of church courts, and the dynamism of the Scottish legal system in this period promoted the emergence and development of a recognisable legal profession. Aberdeen and its region allow for an examination of how the law courts, and lawyers, inter-related and interacted, and from a ‘provincial’ perspective rather than that of the governmental and legal hub of Edinburgh.',
